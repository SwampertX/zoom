# Zoom

### Firefox extension under development

Inspired by a 1080p laptop screen, Firefox Quantum (that does not support default zoom like Google Chrome does), and [Prism-Break](prism-break.org)(pledge loyalty to FOSS).


[**Update (10/09/18)**] : A minimum viable product is out! Scales rigidly. Waiting to do a individual element/text/images scaling.

## Testing
```
git clone https://github.com/SwampertX/zoom.git
firefox about:debugging
```
Click on the ``` Load Temporary Add-On ``` button, and ```select zoom/manifest.json```.


Worth mentioning that he's trying `Git`, `Markdown` and `JavaScript` for the first time.:tada::tada:
