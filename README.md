#Zoom

###a Firefox extension under development

Inspired by a 1080p laptop screen, Firefox Quantum that does not support default zoom like Google Chrome does, and [Prism-Break](prism-break.org).


Yee Jian is currently reading the [Mozilla Foundation guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_second_WebExtension) on building a slightly complex (_actually not at all_) extension.


Worth mentioning that he's trying `Git`, `Markdown` and `JavaScript` for the first time.:tada::tada:
